# Mean-Stream

Mean-Stream is a full-stack starter kit for building scalable, production ready applications with Angular, NestJS, and MongoDB.
It aims to make it easy to get integrate the frameworks into a single project using Nx for code sharing.
Mean-Stream consists of the following libraries:

- [Nestx](libs/nestx/README.md) - A collection of utilities for NestJS
- [Ngbx](libs/ngbx/README.md) - A collection of utilities for Angular and ng-bootstrap

All libraries can also be used standalone without a monorepo.

## Development server

Run `nx serve nestx` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Understand this workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects.
